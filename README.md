# PiHoleBlockList
Stop Windows, Google, Samsung, LG and Xiaomi from spying on you.

# What is PiHoleBlockList?

PiHoleBlockList is a way to block ads, trackers and phishing websites from Windows, Google, Samsung, LG and Xiaomi.

# How does PiHoleBlockList work?

If you configure your hosts file adding the differents domains of the lists included en PiHoleBlockList, every time a website sends an ad or phishing request, your pc will be redirected to 0.0.0.0 ip address and the domain will be blocked at dns level.

# How to use Adguard DNS?

This lists of blocked domains are for my private use with the PiHole script --> https://pi-hole.net/

Feel free to use them in PiHole or in your hosts file.

# What's next?

I'll continue adding more domains in the near future.
